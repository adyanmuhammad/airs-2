### Nursery & Pre-School
The early years learning sector has a ’duty of care’ to the people within it, to provide a safe environment. Caring and learning doesn’t only take place indoors, the outdoor classroom is increasing part of children’s development, but with that comes dirt and potential infection – keeping your environment a safe and clean place to grow is essential.

The education of the early years group, where children’s immune systems are not yet fully developed, can often become a ‘breeding ground’ for infections, quickly carried from child to child. Working within this environment, with constant exposure to infection can also impact the health of staff.

Their interaction with other staff members, families and the community, can lead to high levels of absenteeism. To keep attendance levels high it is essential to deal with infections effectively and protect against the spread of viruses and infections.

From kitchens, toilets, classrooms, staff areas and offices to communal areas, AIRS ENVIRONMENTAL LTD range of products work at the microbial level. They clean, disinfect, remove odours and leave an invisible layer of protection against re-infection, ensuring the welfare of those learning, visiting and working in the early years’ environment.

When an outbreak of infection or virus, such as the ‘winter vomiting’ Norovirus, occurs within a school it has the potential to quickly spread between classmates. A ‘deep clean’ is essential to eliminate the infection, but it won’t protect from future outbreaks.

This “residual protection” is safe to be used around people of all ages, and leaves the surfaces protected from future infection. Once the nursery or preschool has been cleaned with AIRS ENVIRONMENTAL LTD products, it will not only look and smell clean, but it will be microbiologically clean and protected. Providing a safer environment for children, visitors and your team.

To maintain infection control, AIRS ENVIRONMENTAL LTD also offer a hand-washing sanitiser which removes harmful microbes and provides protection for up to 24 hours from a single application.
