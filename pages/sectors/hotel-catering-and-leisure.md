### Hotel, Catering & Leisure Industry
With increasing numbers of reviews on websites, it is essential that you provide a great customer experience. The appearance of cleanliness is not enough, facilities need to be spotless and hygienically clean.

Businesses are hit hard by any reviews claiming that they ‘became ill’ due to the level of cleanliness. So how do you ensure this doesn’t happen to you? Regular cleaning products rely on reaching every part of the surface to physically remove micro-organisms, rather than contain biocides to kill the microbes. ​AIRS ENVIRONMENTAL LTD products use static to attract the biocide to all surfaces, leaving an invisible, protective layer with a single application.

From kitchens, bathrooms, bedrooms, gyms, pools and spas to communal areas, ​AIRS ENVIRONMENTAL LTD range of products work at the microbial level. They clean, disinfect, remove odours and leave an invisible layer of protection against re-infection, ensuring the welfare of both customers and staff.

Regular cleaning products rely on reaching every part of the surface to physically remove microorganisms, rather than contain biocides to kill the microbes. ​AIRS ENVIRONMENTAL LTD products use static to attract the biocide to all surfaces, leaving an invisible, protective layer with a single application. This “residual protection” is safe to contact by people, and leaves the surfaces protected from future infection.

Once the venue has been cleaned with ​AIRS ENVIRONMENTAL LTD technology, it will not only look and smell clean, but it will be microbiologically clean and protected. Providing a safer environment for visitors and your team.
 
To combat potential infection, such as Norovirus, transfer from common surfaces, ​AIRS ENVIRONMENTAL LTD also offer a hand-washing sanitiser which removes harmful microbes and provides protection for up to 24 hours from a single application.
