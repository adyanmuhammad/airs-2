### Poultry & Poultry Processing Industry
The rise of media coverage of pathogens such as Avian Flu within the poultry industry has focussed attention on the cleaning and disinfection processes used. Confirmed outbreaks have had a serious effect on poultry businesses, with farm closures, infections in hatcheries, and the reduction of viable egg yield.

To maximize revenue and minimize bird morbidity, the industry requires exceptionally high standards of hygiene throughout the complex processes. Hatcheries cleaning egg incubators to ensure that live eggs are viable, poultry broiler shed require hygiene procedures in the sheds between the six week growth periods, including the water drinkers.

To minimize cross-infection, the transport vehicles require full decontamination when leaving or arriving at the farm or processing plant.
