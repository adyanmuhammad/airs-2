### Vetinary & Animal Welfare Clinics
In the highly competitive market of veterinary and animal healthcare, image is important and a major part of that image is the cleanliness of the environment. Staff and clients know that many animals attending will be sick, carrying potentially transferrable infections, so ensuring that the space looks and smells clean, in addition to being safe from infection is essential.

Cleaning products specifically designed to clean and disinfect surfaces in use with animal health are used by most practices, but the majority of these use standard ingredients which have been used for over 40 years.

With the use of modern technology, ​AIRS ENVIRONMENTAL LTD products proved a higher level of clean, removing the microbes that could potentially spread infections. Following the cleaning action the products leave a residual barrier on all surfaces to protect them from future contamination.

This “residual protection”, ingredients and products have been thoroughly tested, proven to be highly effective, non-toxic and safe for both people and animals.
